# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard is performing a review of their workforce.  They are aware that there is potential for a 'silver tsunamni'; that is, a large number of their employees are heading to retirement.  In order to understand the full impact this will have on the company, we are performing an analysis on their database to determine who is approaching retirement.  Additionally, we need to determine who they should be considering for their mentorship program.

## Summary
Hewlett Packard is facing an impending labour shortage due to a large percentage of its senior workforce approaching retirement.  While there is talented and committed individuals in the system eligible for mentorship, Hewlett Packard must begin outside recruitment, as well as expand the criteria for enrollment in the mentorship program for its current workforce.
